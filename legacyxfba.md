Most Side Hustles Set You Up to Fail

You want to build something on the side, but every opportunity seems to drain your time and money. Unlike traditional side hustles, Amazon FBA works because the infrastructure and demand already exist.

Nothing Changes Until You Take Action

You see others posting about their success and wonder when it’s going to be your turn. Here's the truth: it's never your turn unless you actually do something about it.

Amazon FBA lets you build a business that works without you being there 24/7. You don't need a warehouse, employees, or any experience selling online to make it work.

We've made every mistake possible so you don't have to. Instead of wasting months figuring this out the hard way, you get our complete system and a team that's done 7 and 8 figures to walk you through it.

Frequently Asked Questions

Here's what our students typically ask before diving into Amazon FBA:

What is Amazon FBA and how does it work?

FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) allows you to sell private label products while Amazon takes care of the heavy lifting. You source the products, send them to Amazon's fulfillment centers, and Amazon handles everything else—storage, packing, shipping, returns, and even customer service. This lets you run your business from anywhere, on just your laptop, without dealing with complex operations.

Do I need e-com experience to start my Amazon FBA business?

No. You don't need any prior e-commerce experience, business background, or technical skills to get started. Our program is designed so that anybody can start from scratch. We cover the very basics, from setting up your business to understanding Amazon's platform and finding your first product. We walk you through everything step-by-step, so you'll know exactly what to do even if you've never sold a single thing online.

What's included in the LegacyX FBA program?

You get:

\- Your first product concept picked by our mentors

\- Community support inside our private Facebook group

\- Weekly live coaching calls plus specialized masterclasses

\- 20+ hours of step-by-step video tutorials

\- Complete resources (PDFs, templates, tools, and more)

\- Access to our FBA service hub at exclusive rates

Will my access expire?

You get unilimited access to everything, including all future course updates. Once you're in, you can access the training from any device, anytime, for as long as you want.

Is this self-paced or do I need to keep up with a group?

It's completely self-paced. You can start immediately and move through the curriculum at whatever speed works for your schedule. No group timelines or deadlines to stress about. Learn and implement when it's convenient for you.

Do you have a refund policy?

Your satisfaction matters to us. If our program doesn't meet your expectations, reach out within 14 days of your purchase date. You’ll get a full refund, as long as:

1\. You haven’t completed more than 20% of the course content or used a coaching call

2\. You haven’t accessed our mentorship and/or product verification services

Important: Refunds aren't available for payment plan purchases or discounted enrollments. Any attempt to manipulate course content will void eligibility. For more details, review our full Refund Policy.

No More Excuses.Make Your Move.

The only thing standing between you and your goals is you. So start taking action.

DISCLAIMER: Any success story or testimonial featured here represents specific results achieved by ourselves or individual students under particular circumstances. These results are not typical and should not be expected. They are not indicative of potential profitability for everyone. While we provide comprehensive training and support, Amazon FBA businesses involve inherent financial risks, significant time investment, and no guarantee of profit. Individual results vary based on numerous factors—including but not limited to your experience, dedication, market conditions, available capital, and numerous other variables beyond our control. We make no earnings claims, income representations, or profit guarantees of any kind. Building any business requires commitment, substantial effort, and consistent action with no assurance of success. If you're not willing to accept that, do not opt in for this program. Additionally, product concept grades may vary over time. Market data is dynamic and constantly evolving. Although the concept received a B grade or higher at the time of assessment, its grade may shift over time due to changes in competition, consumer behavior, or overall market demand.
