## Setup

   ADMIN_ROLE_ID=your_admin_role_id
   GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID=your_google_sheets_id
   ```

3. **Google Sheets Setup:**
   - Ensure `service_account_secret.json` is in the project root
   - Create a Google Sheet with columns: Name, Discord ID, Thread ID, Status, Channel Link, Created At
   - Share the sheet with the service account email from the JSON file

4. **Discord Bot Setup:**

   - Enable the following bot permissions:
     - Read Messages/View Channels
     - Send Messages
     - Create Private Threads
     - Manage Threads
     - Use Slash Commands

2. The thread includes the new member and all users with the admin role
3. The bot sends a welcome message with a "Mark as Solved" button

5. Users can click buttons to change thread status, which updates both Discord and Google Sheets
